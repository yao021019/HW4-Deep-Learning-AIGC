I have completed the handwriting recognition application. The application window is now open on your screen.

You can draw a digit on the canvas and click "Predict" to see the result.

I have also created a `README.md` file that explains the project structure and how to run the application again in the future. I have opened the project directory for you to see all the files we've created.

If you have any other requests, feel free to ask!
